# Websocket Feed

Websocket api can be used for the following use cases

- Get real time feed of market data, this includes L2 and L3 orderbook and recent trades.
- Get price feeds - Mark prices of different contracts, price feed of underlying indexes etc.
- Get account specific notifications like fills, liquidations, [ADL](https://www.delta.exchange/user-guide/docs/trading-guide/ADL/) and PnL updates.

# Subscribing to Channels

## Subscribe

To begin receiving feed messages, you must first send a subscribe message to the server indicating which channels and contracts to subscribe for. This message is mandatory â€” you will be disconnected if no subscribe has been received within 60 seconds.

To specify contracts within each channel, just pass a list of symbols inside the channel payload.

Once a subscribe message is received the server will respond with a subscriptions message that lists all channels you are subscribed to. Subsequent subscribe messages will add to the list of subscriptions.

> Subscription Sample

```
// Request
// Subscribe to BTCUSD_28Dec and ETHBTC_28Dec with the ticker and orderbookL2 channels,
{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {
                "name": "ticker",
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD_28Dec",
                    "ETHBTC_28Dec"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "l2_orderbook",
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD_28Dec"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}

// Response
{
    "type": "subscriptions",
    "channels": [
        {
            "name": "l2_orderbook",
            "symbols": [
                "BTCUSD_28Dec"
            ],
        },
        {
            "name": "ticker",
            "symbols": [
                "BTCUSD_28Dec",
                "ETHBTC_28Dec"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

// Error Response 
{
    "type": "subscriptions",
    "channels": [
        {
            "name": "l2_orderbook",
            "symbols": [
                "BTCUSD_28Dec"
            ],
        },
        {
            "name": "trading_notifications",
            "error": "subscription forbidden on trading_notifications. Unauthorized user"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Unsubscribe

If you want to unsubscribe from channel/contracts pairs, send an "unsubscribe" message. The structure is equivalent to subscribe messages. If you want to unsubscribe for specific symbols in a channel, you can pass it in the symbol list. As a shorthand you can also provide no symbols for a channel, which will unsubscribe you from the channel entirely.

> Unsubscribe Sample

```
// Request
{
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {
                "name": "ticker",          // unsubscribe from ticker channel only for BTCUSD_28Dec
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD_28Dec"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "l2_orderbook"      // unsubscribe from all symbols for l2_orderbook channel
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Authenticating a connection

Authentication allows clients to receives private messages, like trading notifications. Examples of the trading notifications are: fills, liquidations, [adl](/#trading-notitifications) and pnl updates.

To authenticate, you need to send a signed request of type 'auth' on your socket connection. Check the authentication section above for more details on how to sign a request using api key and secret.

The payload for the signed request will be
'GET' + timestamp + '/live'

To subscribe to private channels, the client needs to first send an auth event, providing api-key, and signature. 

> Authentication sample

```python
// auth message with signed request
import websocket
import hashlib
import hmac
import base64

api_key = 'a207900b7693435a8fa9230a38195d'
api_secret = '7b6f39dcf660ec1c7c664f612c60410a2bd0c258416b498bf0311f94228f'

def generate_signature(secret, message):
    message = bytes(message, 'utf-8')
    secret = bytes(secret, 'utf-8')
    hash = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha256)
    return hash.hexdigest()

def get_time_stamp():
    d = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
    epoch = datetime.datetime(1970,1,1)
    return str(int((d - epoch).total_seconds()))

# Get open orders
method = 'GET'
timestamp = get_time_stamp()
path = '/live'
signature_data = method + timestamp + path
signature = generate_signature(api_secret, signature_data)


ws = websocket.WebSocketApp('wss://api.delta.exchange:2096')
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": "auth",
    "payload": {
        "api-key": api_key,
        "signature": signature,
        "timestamp": timestamp
    }
}))
```

```nodejs

```

To unsubscribe from all private channels, just send a 'unauth' message on the socket. This will automatically unsubscribe the connection from all authenticated channels.

```python
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": 'unauth',
    "payload": {}
}))

```

# Detecting Connection Drops
Some client libraries might not detect connection drops properly. We provide two methods for the clients to ensure they are connected and getting subscribed data.

## Heartbeat (Recommended)
The client can enable heartbeat on the socket. If heartbeat is enabled, the server is expected to periodically send a heartbeat message to the client. Right now, the heartbeat time is set to 30 seconds. 

### How to Implement on client side

- Enable heartbeat (check sample code) after each successful socket connection
- Set a timer with duration of 35 seconds (We take 5 seconds buffer for heartbeat to arrive).
- When you receive a new heartbeat message, you reset the timer
- If the timer is called, that means the client didn't receive any heartbeat in last 35 seconds. In this case, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```
// Enable Heartbeat on successful connection
ws.send({
    "type": "enable_heartbeat"
})

// Disable Heartbeat
ws.send({
    "type": "disable_heartbeat"
})

// Sample Heartbeat message received periodically by client
{
    "type": "heartbeat"
}
```


## Ping/Pong
The client can periodically (~ every 30 seconds) send a ping frame or a raw ping message and the server will respond back with a pong frame or a raw pong response. If the client doesn't receive a pong response in next 5 seconds, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```
// Ping Request
ws.send({
    "type": "ping"
})

// Pong Response
ws.send({
    "type": "pong"
})
```

# Public Channels

## v2 ticker

The ticker channel provides price change data for the last 24 hrs (rolling window). It is published every 5 seconds.

On subscribing to **v2/ticker** channel, socket server will emit messages with type 'ticker' in response.

>  Product Updates Sample

```
// Market Disruption Response
{
    "type":"product_updates",
    "event":"market_disruption",
    "product":{
        "id":17,
        "symbol":"NEOUSDQ",
        "trading_status":"disrupted_cancel_only",
    },
    "timestamp": 1561634049751430,
}

// Auction Started Response
{
    "type":"product_updates",
    "event":"start_auction",
    "product":{
        "id":17,
        "symbol":"NEOUSDQ",

        "trading_status":"operational",
    },
    "timestamp": 1561634049751430,
}
```
### Market Disruption
When markets are disrupted, orderbook enters into cancel only mode. You can refer to "trading_status" field in product info to determine this. In cancel only mode, you can only cancel your orders. No matching happens in this mode.

### Auction Started
When markets need to come up, we conduct a single price auction. In this case, orderbook enters into post only mode. In post only mode, you can post new orders, cancel exisiting orders, add more margin to open positions. No matching happens in this mode. It is possible to see an overlap between asks and bids during this time.


### Auction Finished
When auction finishes, markets enter into operational mode and trading continues as usual. 

You can read more about the single price auction [here](https://www.delta.exchange/blog/bootstrapping-liquidity-using-auctions/)

        This is the commission required for the portfolio. It is added on top of the initial margin requirement.
- blocked_margin - 
        This is the actual blocked margin that we were able to block from the wallet balance to fullfill the initial margin and commissions requirement
- futures_margin_floor - 
        This is the Margin Floor requirement contributed by futures
- long_options_margin_floor -
        This is the Margin Floor requirement contributed by long options position/orders
- short_options_margin_floor - 
        This is the Margin Floor requirement contributed by short options position/orders
- margin_floor - 
          margin_floor = long_options_margin_floor + short_options_margin_floor
- risk_margin - 
          This is the Risk Margin requirement calculated as per our stress scenarios
- risk_matrix -
          Matrix showing details for all the stress scenarios 
- positions_upl - 
          This is the UCF which summations of all positions marked at mark price. More details in user guide
- liquidation_risk
          This is a flag showing if the portfolio is in liquidation risk.
            ideally when 
              blocked_margin < im_w_ucf + commissions
                In such situation the portfolio is not sufficiently margined
                After some cusion we start sending liquidation_risk as true indicating a potential liquidation 
                So while placing new orders this deficit also needs to be fulfilled along with any additional margin requirement for the order
              blocked_margin < mm_w_ucf
                This is our liquidation condition
- under_liquidation
          This is a flag showing if the portfolio is under liquidation.
          During this process we follow all our liquidation steps which can be seen here
- under_liquidation
          This is the shortfall value in margin to not be under liquidation risk
